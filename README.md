- **Next.js App Router** based fundamentals application that demonstrates the core concepts and modern features of Next.js. 
- In-depth look into NextJS modern architecture.


## ðŸš€ Technologies & Key Learnings

- **App Router**: File-based routing and error handling with special files like `page.js`, `layout.js`, `error.js`, `not-found.js`, and `loading.js`.  
- **Dynamic Routes**: Creating pages with path segments that are not known in advance.  
- **Server & Client Components**: Understanding that components are server components by default in Next.js, and converting them to client components with `use client`.  
- **React Hooks**: Using `useState` and `useRef`.  
- **Server Actions**: Async functions with the `use server` directive, assigned to the `action` prop of forms.  
- **Form Handling**: Managing responses with `useFormState` and submission status with `useFormStatus`.  
- **Data Revalidation**: Handling Next.js caching with `revalidatePath` to fetch the latest data.  
- **Metadata**: Managing static and dynamic metadata for page titles and descriptions.
